- Essential background on speech production and perception, probability and information theory, and pattern recognition
- Extracting information from the speech signal: useful representations and practical compression solutions
- Modern speech recognition techniques: hidden Markov models, acoustic and language modeling, improving resistance to environmental noises, search algorithms, and large vocabulary speech recognition
- Text-to-speech: analyzing documents, pitch and duration controls; trainable synthesis, and more
- Spoken language understanding: dialog management, spoken language applications, and multimodal interfaces
